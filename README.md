**Tell me about yourself**  
- Software Developer
- I love to solve backend programming problems 
- Kirill Lesnykh:
- My name is Kirill Lesnykh, to make it easier on others I go by Kirk. I am a software developer who just graduated. Before this my work was owning and running Kirks Renovations, which is a company that remodels Kitchens and bathrooms primarily. I’ve had to learn a good amount of leadership skills through the struggle of owning a business, as well as learn how to juggle peoples strengths on my team to make the final product the best quality delivered at a reasonable timeline. I did go to college 6 years ago for a computer science degree. That was my first passion because I was able to solve fun problems and see the outcome of my work from the user end, and it’s what drives me today. I do prefer the backend side of developing a bit more, that’s where the puzzle/problem solving comes in and that’s what’s fun for me
- What excites me most about tech is being able to help people out that don't know how to use tech effectively. I also am excited to work for a job thats actually fun for me
